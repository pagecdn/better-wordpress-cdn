== Description ==

PageCDN's Easy Speedup Plugin will speed up your wordpress website by up to 10x and is 10x easier to set up. You will need little technical know-how to get maximum website speed with this incredibly sophisticated yet easy to install plugin.

== Free CDN ==

Our [free CDN](https://pagecdn.com/public-cdn) accelerates open source libraries, thousands of WordPress themes and plugins, fonts and more. It takes each resource separately and intelligently optimizes it using the best information available.

The benefit of our free CDN is that many websites re-use the same free files on our CDN. This allows browsers to share cache of one website with the other. So, the free CDN not only comes with free bandwidth, it enables cache re-use at internet scale - that ultimately makes your site faster than ever.
