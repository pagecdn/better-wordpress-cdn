# PageCDN - WordPress CDN Plugin

Enable PageCDN to serve your static assets such as images, fonts, CSS or JavaScript files in the best way possible. Instead of just replacing hostname with CDN hostname, this plugin takes each resource separately and tries to get its most optimized version from PageCDN using the Public API.

## Features
* Link assets to load from PageCDN
* Set directories to be optimized through plugin
* Set directories and file extensions to be ignored
* Full HTTPS support
* Full HTTP/2 support
* HTTP/2 Server Push support (through PageCDN settings panel)
* Automatically optimize DNS lookups and HTTP caching by loading [better optimized fonts](https://pagecdn.com/lib/easyfonts)
* Automatically optimize DNS lookups by changing all the Public CDN resources to load from single [Public CDN](https://pagecdn.com/dashboard)
* Automatically optimize delivery by searching and linking library files from [Opensource CDN](https://pagecdn.com/lib) for better performance
* Automatically optimize delivery by searching and linking theme files from [Opensource Themes CDN](https://pagecdn.com/theme) for better performance
* Automatically optimize content by searching and linking minified version of files from Public CDN
